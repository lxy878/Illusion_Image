# C++ Project - *DriftIllusion*

## Description:
The program works to create a simple image by implementing OpenGL framework.   The image, 4X2 equally-spaced rings, is constructed by three rectangulars with transformations of the rotation and the translation.  It will cause the peripheral drift illusion to viewers, who look at one of rings and feel other rings rotating counterclockwise or clockwise.
